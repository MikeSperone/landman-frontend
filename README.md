This is a front end UI for Geoffrey Landman's phd thesis of cataloging the fingerings and resulting audio sounds for the saxophone.

This project was bootstrapped with the Create React App framework.

To begin local development, you may follow these steps:

1. create a new folder and clone the git directory into it
```
mkdir landman-frontend
cd landman-frontend
git clone https://github.com/MikeSperone/landman-frontend.git .
```

2. install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. create the initial build
```
npm run build
```

4. start the development server
```
npm start
```

And you are ready to go!
The page will be viewable at http://localhost:3000, and will update as you save your changes.
Lint errors will also display in the console.
